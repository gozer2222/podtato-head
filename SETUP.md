# Setup a local environment

## Local K8S cluster

- Install [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) :

```
curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.9.0/kind-linux-amd64
chmod +x ./kind
sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind
```

- Create a kind cluster :

```
kind create cluster
```

Your current terminal is automatically configured to point to your kind cluster.
If you use other terminals, do not forget to configure your KUBECONFIG environment variable :
```
export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/.kind/config
```

- Check cluster :

```
kubectl cluster-info
```

- If images have only been built locally, load them into your kind cluster :

```
kind load docker-image yogeek/hello-server:v0.1.0
kind load docker-image yogeek/hello-server:v0.1.1
kind load docker-image yogeek/hello-server:v0.1.2
```

## Get LoadBalancer feature with kind+MetalLB

Kubernetes on kind (like in bare metal) doesnâ€™t come with an easy integration for things like services of type LoadBalancer.
This mechanism is used to expose services inside the cluster using an external Load Balancing mechansim that understands how to route traffic down to the pods defined by that service.

To achieve a similar feature, [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/installation/) can be used.

```
./setup/metal-lb/install.sh
```

Now, every `LoadBalancer` service will have an external IP assigned automatically and will be available at this IP.

## Istio + addons (prometheus, kiali...)

Istio is used by progessive delivery tools (Flagger, Argo Rollouts...).

```
./setup/istio/install.sh
./setup/istio/addons.sh
```

## Local tools

```
# Helm 3
./setup/charts/setup/install.sh

# Kustomize
./setup/kustomize/setup/install.sh

# Kapp
./setup/kapp/setup/install.sh
```

## Useful tools

- Install [kubefwd](https://github.com/txn2/kubefwd) to easily port forward K8S services.

```
curl https://i.jpillora.com/txn2/kubefwd! | sudo bash
kubefwd version
```


## MAGIC SHORTCUT : Load preconfigured cluster from backup

```
./setup/velero/install.sh
./setup/velero/restore.sh <BACKUP_PATH>
```
