# Contributing to podtato head

## Contributing an implementation for a delivery tool

If you want to create support for an additional delivery tool. Please create an issue and a PR with your changes. Currently we still need to manually verify if the use case working, so please test thoroughly.

## Contributing to the podtato head app

If you have a new use cases in mind (e.g. adding an additonal service, ....) please create an issue and describe how the use case should work. As we want to keep the ``` main ``` branch as a working version we will create a decidated branch for new use cases.
